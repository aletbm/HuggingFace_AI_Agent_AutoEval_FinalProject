        "\n",
        "Follow this process strictly:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Analyze the user question:\n",
        "   - Determine the exact required output type (number, string, list, etc).\n",
        "   - Identify key entities, constraints, and any implicit requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Do NOT rely on common knowledge, heuristics, or general assumptions:\n",
        "   - For any classification task (e.g., botanical categories), you MUST verify each item explicitly against formal, authoritative sources.\n",
        "   - Use online searches, databases, or reference tools to confirm the classification.\n",
        "   - If verification is not possible due to tool limitations or lack of available sources:\n",
        "     - Only then, you may deduce the answer based on structured, logical knowledge or definitions (e.g., taxonomy, anatomy, mathematics, etc.).\n",

        "     - Do NOT rely on common knowledge, cultural conventions, popular usage, heuristics, or guesses.\n",
        "     - Your deduction must be explainable based on first principles or formal definitions, and include explicit logical steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. If tools are needed:\n",
        "   - Devise a clear, step-by-step plan including:\n",
        "     - Reasoning and sequence of tool usage.\n",
        "     - Search queries tailored to find authoritative definitions or classifications.\n",
        "     - Use a version of the question optimized for search engines (DuckDuckGo).\n",

        "   - Do not execute any tool until the entire plan is ready.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Search query rules:\n",
        "   - Be keyword-focused (avoid full sentences).\n",
        "   - Target reputable sources such as academic, botanical databases, government or educational sites.\n",
        "   - Use advanced operators if helpful: `site:` for domains, `inurl:` for internal paths, `filetype:` for formats.\n",
        "   - Avoid punctuation, commas, quotes, or special characters.\n",
        "   - Cover multiple query angles if needed.\n",

        "   - Exclude any item without clear, explicit verification.\n",

        "   - When sorting a list of strings alphabetically:\n",
        "     - Perform a case-insensitive alphabetical sort using `sorted(list, key=lambda x: x.lower())`.\n",

        "     - Return the result as a comma-separated list of strings, with exact original wording preserved.\n",
        "   - When working with tables extracted from Excel files (`data_table`, `color_table`):\n",
        "     - Use Pandas to structure the data as DataFrames and perform precise queries, filters, aggregations, comparisons, or transformations.\n",
        "     - Ensure that each operation respects the original cell structure and types (text, numeric, empty).\n",
        "     - Avoid assumptions — validate presence of values explicitly and handle missing or \"None\" cells cautiously.\n",

        "   - Preserve the original wording exactly as it appears, except convert number words to digits.\n",
        "   - Do NOT paraphrase, summarize, or alter expressions.\n",
        "   - Do NOT remove adjectives, simplify phrases, or make any linguistic modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. When dealing with names, entities, or roles:\n",
        "    - Pay close attention to context: distinguish between a person (e.g., actor) and the role they played (e.g., character).\n",
        "    - If a question references both a person and their role, ensure the output matches exactly what the question asks for.\n",
        "    - Do not confuse names of real people with names of characters, places, or concepts unless explicitly intended.\n",

She won the Premio Gardel in 2000, the main musical award in Argentina. She served as an ambassador for UNICEF.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\nSosa was born on 9 July 1935, in San Miguel de Tucumán, in the northwestern Argentine province of Tucumán, of mestizo ancestry. She was of French, Spanish and Diaguita descent. Her nickname \"la negra\", which is a common nickname in Argentina for people with darker complexion, is a reference to her indigenous heritage. Her parents, a day laborer and a washerwoman, were Peronists, although they never registered in the party, and she started her career as a singer for the Peronist Party in Tucuman under the name Gladys Osorio. In 1950, at age fifteen, she won a singing competition organized by a local radio station and was given a contract to perform for two months. She recorded her first album, La Voz de la Zafra, in 1959. A performance at the 1965 Cosquín National Folklore Festival—where she was introduced and brought to the stage while sitting in the audience by fellow folk singer Jorge Cafrune— brought her to the attention of the Argentine public. Sosa and her first husband, Manuel Oscar Matus, with whom she had one son, were key players in the mid-60s nueva canción movement (which was called nuevo cancionero in Argentina). Her second record was Canciones con Fundamento, a collection of Argentine folk songs.\\n\\nSosa \"spent the late 1960s building her audience in Europe and among the cosmopolitan middle class in Buenos Aires, becoming in the process a much bigger star\" than her contemporaries. In 1967, Sosa toured the United States and Europe with great success. In later years, she performed and recorded extensively, broadening her repertoire to include material from throughout Latin America.\\nIn the early 1970s, Sosa released two concept albums in collaboration with composer Ariel Ramírez and lyricist Félix Luna: Cantata Sudamericana and Mujeres Argentinas (Argentine Women). She also recorded a tribute to Chilean musician Violeta Parra in 1971, including what was to become one of Sosa\\'s signature songs, Gracias a la vida. She further popularized of songs written by Milton Nascimento of Brazil and Pablo Milanés and Silvio Rodríguez both from Cuba. Throughout the decade, she released albums such as Hasta la Victoria in 1972 and Traigo un Pueblo en mi Voz in 1973.

His father, José Sosa Esquivel, was an operatic tenor (tenor comprimario) and his mother, Margarita Ortiz, was a classical pianist. When José showed interest in singing, they tried to discourage him claiming that it was too difficult to be successful in show business. In that time, his reportedly alcoholic father abandoned the family forcing José to work to help his mother and younger brother.\\n\\n\\n=== 1963–1969: Early career ===\\nAt the age of fifteen, his mother gave him his first piano. Besides working in his teens, he learned to play guitar and sang in the church and in serenades along with his neighborhood friends for extra money.\\nIn 1967, at the age of 19, José formed Los Peg, a Mexican band of bossa nova/jazz. Although they made several recordings as a group, they did not reach commercial success. In 1965, under the name of \"Pepe Sosa\" and pursuing a solo career encouraged by his mother, he recorded the singles \"Ma vie\" and \"El Mundo\", which did not sell well either. He made a career breakthrough when he was invited to perform a song for a friend\\'s sister on her birthday.

It was arranged by his former teacher Mario Patrón, who was considered the best jazz musician of Mexico, and employed Brazilian percussionist Mayuto Correa, who was in Mexico City playing with bossa nova stars João Gilberto, Carlos Lyra, Leny Andrade, and Tamba Trio.

As a teenager, she became involved with a variety of social causes early in her life, including civil rights and non-violence. She then turned to singing in public places, colleges and universities in 1972 until becoming part of the Nueva canción, a new song movement of Latin America, which was to spread throughout the Caribbean, Central and South America in the 1970s and 1980s. Successful artists of the genre such as Soledad Bravo, Victor Jara, Violeta Parra, Mercedes Sosa. Atahualpa Yupanqui and Alfredo Zitarrosa inspired the way forward for Vera, as she said in an interview with folk historian Rafael Salazar. In addition to performing a repertoire of significant Venezuelan songwriters, Vera pledged allegiance to these artists, in part because they represent key figures in the new movement but also because she performed some songs of their extensive repertoire. Similarly, she was a founding member of both the International Committee of the New Latin American Song and the National Federation of Popular Culture in Venezuela.\\n\\n\\n=== Professional singer ===\\nIn 1974 Vera made her self-titled debut album for Talirai, an independent label founded by Lilia, together with her companion Alberto Vera and the culture promoter Oswaldo Lares. The album was entitled Lilia Vera, plain and simple. By then, fame and popularity were not important to her. Instead, she earned the more important qualities of respect and admiration from her peers. On this album, Vera sang emotional renditions of \"Caramba\", \"Pueblos tristes\", \"Duerme, mi tripón\", \"Flor de Mayo\" and \"Pajarillo verde\", all composed by musician and poet Otilio Galíndez, making an immediate impact on new audiences or existing ones. All these are factors in her art no less potent than his sensitive voice, and the total effect to establish an intimacy with her audience which even an unfamiliar musical language cannot strain.\\nAt this time, Vera received further vocal training in Caracas then was signed by the Promus record label, where she recorded two albums in 1976 (Lilia Vera Vol. 2 and 3) and one in 1977 (Vol. 4). While at Promus, she interpreted songs composed by musicians and songwriters Alberto Arvelo Torrealba, Simón Díaz, Conny Méndez and Luis Mariano Rivera, as well as the aforementioned Galíndez, among others. Vera later returned to Promus and released her album Lilia Vera Vol. 5 in 1983, in which she recorded the traditional tune \"Tonada\", compiled by the veteran harpist Indio Figueredo, as well as a handful of songs composed by new songwriters. Overall, in these four records she scored hits with songs as diverse as \"El becerrito\", \"Chucho y Ceferina\", \"Clavelito Colorado\", \"Arbolito sabanero\", \"Lucerito\", \"La culebra\" and \"Canchunchú dichoso\".\\nIn between, Vera collaborated with Simón Díaz in his record Duetos (1998), with Ilan Chester in Ofrenda para un niño (1999), and with Magdalena Sánchez in Duetos de leyenda (1999).\\nHer most significant international performance was in 1981, when she recorded a duet album along with Pablo Milanés to perform a repertoire consisting of traditional Venezuelan songs and Cuban Nueva trova. The record was produced by the Areito label (Cuba) and co-produced by Interamericana de Grabaciones (Venezuela). Recorded at EGREM studios in La Habana, the record was pressed at 33 ⅓ rpm and was titled originally Lilia Vera y Pablo Milanés. It was reissued in CD format in 1998 by Universal Music Latino and was renamed Pablo Milanés – Con Lilia Vera.\\nLilia Vera is still active in concerts and shows.

One of her first cousins is actor Kevin Bacon (their mothers are sisters).\\n\\n\\n== Early years ==\\nShe was eight years old when she first performed publicly, and she auditioned for Columbia Records when she was ten. She sang in all the high school musicals, talent shows and often was invited to sing at gatherings of local service groups, such as the Soroptimist Club, Lions Club, and Garden Club. Her senior year she played Eliza Doolittle in the Ukiah High School production of My Fair Lady. In the summer Near attended performing arts camps such as Perry-Mansfield in Colorado and Ramblerny Performing Arts where she studied with jazz musicians Phil Woods and his wife, Chan Parker (Parker was married to Woods but retained the name Parker from her earlier, common law marriage to Charlie Parker), and modern dancer/choreographer Joyce Trisler. \\nAfter starting high school in 1963, Near began singing with three boys who called themselves the Freedom Singers, a folk group modeled after The Kingston Trio. When Near joined, they began to sound more like The Weavers, with three male voices and one female. Near learned later of the original Freedom Singers who sang as part of the Civil Rights Movement. Unbeknownst to her, Near would soon meet one of the founding members of that group, Dr. Bernice Johnson Reagon, an artist who would be a great influence for the next 40-plus years. She would also meet and work with the female singer in The Weavers, Ronnie Gilbert. \\nAfter high school, Near enrolled in the Theatre Arts program at UCLA; her freshman year she got the lead in the UCLA  production of Guys and Dolls playing soprano Sarah Brown. Because Near was trained in a lower range she got nodules on her vocal cords and had to leave the show. She entered in to a long period of silence until her voice healed. After one year, she left UCLA and began to work in film and television as well as with anti-war groups such as Another Mother for Peace.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\nNear\\'s professional career began in 1969 with a part on the television show The Mod Squad, which was followed by appearances in other shows, such as Room 222, All in the Family, and The Partridge Family.  She also appeared in Angel, Angel, Down We Go, Slaughterhouse-Five, and Minnie and Moskowitz. Much later, she had a prominent role in the 1991 film Dogfight.\\nShe was briefly a member of the musical comedy troupe First National Nothing and appeared on the troupe\\'s only album If You Sit Real Still and Hold My Hand, You Will Hear Absolutely Nothing, released in 1970 on Columbia Records.\\nIn 1970, Near was a cast member of the Broadway musical Hair. Following the Kent State shootings in May of that year, the entire cast staged a silent vigil in protest. The song \"It Could Have Been Me\" (released on A Live Album, 1974) was her response to the shootings. In 1971, she joined the FTA (Free The Army) Tour, an anti-Vietnam War road show of music, comedy, and plays that performed for soldiers, many of whom were resisting war and racism from within the military. The tour was organized by antiwar activist Fred Gardner and actors Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland. Near was only 21 and the youngest member of the troupe. \\nIn 1972, Near founded an independent record label called Redwood Records to produce and promote music by \"politically conscious artists from around the world\". She was one of the first women to found an independent record company. Near\\'s record company went out of business in the mid-1990s due to financial difficulties.\\nDuring her long career in folk and protest music, Near has worked with a wide array of musicians, including Ronnie Gilbert, Pete Seeger, Arlo Guthrie, Mercedes Sosa, Bernice Johnson R')]\n",

He later joined a jazz and bossa nova trio where he sang and played bass and double bass. José José found success as a solo artist in the early 1970s. Demonstrating his tenor vocal ability with a stunning performance of the song \"El Triste\" at a Latin music festival held in Mexico City in 1970, he climbed the Latin charts during that decade. Having achieved recognition as a balladeer, his singing garnered universal critical acclaim from musical peers and media.\n",

He forged a career as an actor, starring in movies such as Gavilán o Paloma (1985) and Perdóname Todo (1995).\n",

She was of French, Spanish and Diaguita descent. Her nickname \"la negra\", which is a common nickname in Argentina for people with darker complexion, is a reference to her indigenous heritage. Her parents, a day laborer and a washerwoman, were Peronists, although they never registered in the party, and she started her career as a singer for the Peronist Party in Tucuman under the name Gladys Osorio. In 1950, at age fifteen, she won a singing competition organized by a local radio station and was given a contract to perform for two months. She recorded her first album, La Voz de la Zafra, in 1959. A performance at the 1965 Cosquín National Folklore Festival—where she was introduced and brought to the stage while sitting in the audience by fellow folk singer Jorge Cafrune— brought her to the attention of the Argentine public. Sosa and her first husband, Manuel Oscar Matus, with whom she had one son, were key players in the mid-60s nueva canción movement (which was called nuevo cancionero in Argentina). Her second record was Canciones con Fundamento, a collection of Argentine folk songs.\\n\\nSosa \"spent the late 1960s building her audience in Europe and among the cosmopolitan middle class in Buenos Aires, becoming in the process a much bigger star\" than her contemporaries. In 1967, Sosa toured the United States and Europe with great success. In later years, she performed and recorded extensively, broadening her repertoire to include material from throughout Latin America.\\nIn the early 1970s, Sosa released two concept albums in collaboration with composer Ariel Ramírez and lyricist Félix Luna: Cantata Sudamericana and Mujeres Argentinas (Argentine Women). She also recorded a tribute to Chilean musician Violeta Parra in 1971, including what was to become one of Sosa\\'s signature songs, Gracias a la vida. She further popularized of songs written by Milton Nascimento of Brazil and Pablo Milanés and Silvio Rodríguez both from Cuba. Throughout the decade, she released albums such as Hasta la Victoria in 1972 and Traigo un Pueblo en mi Voz in 1973. They featured songs like \"Cuando tenga la tierra\", written by Ariel Petrocelli and Daniel Toro, which tackles political and social issues like wealth and land inequality. During the 1970s she was a part of two films by the director Leopoldo Torre Nilsson: El Santo de la Espada in 1970 and Güemes, la tierra en armas in 1971, in which she portrayed Juana Azurduy de Padilla, the guerrilla military leader who fought for Argentine independence.\\n\\nAfter the military junta of Jorge Videla came to power in 1976, the atmosphere in Argentina grew increasingly oppressive.

Mercedes Sosa Portrait by Annemarie Heinrich , 1960s Born Haydée Mercedes Sosa ( 1935-07-09 ) 9 July 1935 San Miguel de Tucumán , Tucumán, Argentina Died 4 October 2009 (2009-10-04) (aged 74) Buenos Aires , Argentina Occupation Singer Years active 1950–2009 Musical career Genres Folk nueva canción Instruments Vocals Musical artist Haydée Mercedes \" La Negra \" Sosa ( Latin American Spanish: [meɾˈseðes ˈsosa] ; 9 July 1935 [ 1 ] – 4 October 2009) was an Argentine singer who was popular throughout Latin America and many countries outside the region. With her roots in Argentine folk music , Sosa became one of the preeminent exponents of El nuevo cancionero . She gave voice to songs written by many Latin American songwriters. Her music made people hail her as the \"voice of the voiceless ones\". [ 2 ] She was often called \"the conscience of Latin America\". [ 3 ] Sosa performed in venues such as the Lincoln Center in New York City, the Théâtre Mogador in Paris, the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City, as well as sold-out shows in New York's Carnegie Hall and the Roman Colosseum during her final decade of life. Her career spanned four decades and she was the recipient of six Latin Grammy awards (2000, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2011), including a Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004 and two posthumous Latin Grammy Award for Best Folk Album in 2009 and 2011. She won the Premio Gardel in 2000, the main musical award in Argentina. She served as an ambassador for UNICEF . Life [ edit ] Sosa was born on 9 July 1935, in San Miguel de Tucumán , in the northwestern Argentine province of Tucumán , of mestizo ancestry. She was of French, Spanish and Diaguita descent. [ 4 ] Her nickname \"la negra\", which is a common nickname in Argentina for people with darker complexion, is a reference to her indigenous heritage. [ 5 ] Her parents, a day laborer and a washerwoman, [ 3 ] were Peronists , although they never registered in the party, and she started her career as a singer for the Peronist Party in Tucuman under the name Gladys Osorio. [ 6 ] In 1950, at age fifteen, she won a singing competition organized by a local radio station and was given a contract to perform for two months. [ 7 ] She recorded her first album, La Voz de la Zafra , in 1959. [ 7 ] A performance at the 1965 Cosquín National Folklore Festival —where she was introduced and brought to the stage while sitting in the audience by fellow folk singer Jorge Cafrune — [ 8 ] brought her to the attention of the Argentine public. [ 7 ] Sosa and her first husband, Manuel Oscar Matus , with whom she had one son, were key players in the mid-60s nueva canción movement (which was called nuevo cancionero in Argentina). [ 9 ] Her second record was Canciones con Fundamento , a collection of Argentine folk songs. Sosa with Félix Luna and Ariel Ramírez (at the piano) Sosa \"spent the late 1960s building her audience in Europe and among the cosmopolitan middle class in Buenos Aires, becoming in the process a much bigger star\" than her contemporaries. [ 10 ] In 1967, Sosa toured the United States and Europe with great success. [ citation neede\n",

Penguins have an undeserved reputation as funny and somewhat ridiculous animals and it’s easy to see why: they’re cute, flightless birds that waddle about like fluffy, drunk toddlers. Hollywood casts Danny Devito as your human equivalent for a reason. However, underestimating them is a mistake that might cost you dearly, as one petrel bird discovered when it attacked a group of emperor penguin chicks hoping for an easy meal. Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT. PAGE CONTINUES BELOW More on Nature Animals • article Prince William Launches Groundbreaking S... Asia  • article Filming Cannibal Cormorants Asia  • article Filming Chiru on the Highest Plateau on Earth ADVERTISEMENT. PAGE CONTINUES BELOW As these chicks made their way to the sea without their parents’ supervision for the first time, a predatory giant petrel swooped in for what it thought would prove a quick kill. The chicks initially tried to flee, but struggled with running on land, and, in a case of ironically unhappy feet, one of them slipped and fell, becoming an easy prey to the predatory bird. When the petrel grabbed him by the neck with its strong beak, it looked like there was little or no hope left for the clumsy chick, but a tactical fall allowed it to escape and slide away back to its group. Rejoined by their fallen companion, the chicks assembled into a defensive circle that allowed them to protect each other from all sides. The hunt was brought to a stall. After a tense stand off, the arrival of an adult adelie, a smaller, but extremely feisty species of penguin, finally set the petrel on the run. Predators like the petrel are just one of the many dangers encountered daily by penguins. What strategies do they adopt to survive in one of the most inhospitable environment in the world? Strength in numbers Strength in numbers is the most known survival strategy for penguins. Huddling together allows them to find shelter from the extreme cold and unforgiving snow storms, but also functions as protection to fight off some of the many, deadly predators that inhabit Antarctica. Countershading Disguise is another fundamental skill for the survival of penguins. Their typical black and white coat is more than just a fabulous look: the colour arrangement provides penguins with counter-shading, a method of camouflage used by many animals where their top colour is much darker than their underside. In the case of penguins, it allows them to stay hidden from both predators and preys when in the sea: their white belly blends them with the bright sea surface, while the black feathers make them disappear into the dark bottom of the ocean. Fashionable AND practical! Tobogganing Penguin bellies are not just useful for camouflage: when on land, they are also the tools that provide them with their fastest escape technique, tobogganing, the word that better describes when penguins slide on their belly to gain speed on ice. Curiously, Penguins have been observed tobogganing not only to escape predators or move faster, but also just for fun. Jumping There’s another, amazing technique Penguins use to escape predators, and that’s jumping out of water up to nine feet straight. For small, flightless birds, that seems like an incredible feat, and Penguins achieve it by trapping air bubbles under their plumage before diving. When they then release these air-bubbles as they swim towards the surface, the air coats their bodies like a lubricant, allowing them to achieve the great speed that lets them go airborne once outside the water. These are only some of penguins’ surprising skills. Discover more of their unexpected survival secrets below.

The city of Amsterdam had previously bid for the 1920 and 1924 Olympic Games . Still, it was obliged to give way to war-torn Antwerp in Belgium for the 1920 Games and Pierre de Coubertin 's Paris for the 1924 Games . The only other candidate city for the 1928 Olympics was Los Angeles , which would eventually be selected to host the Olympics four years later. In preparation for the 1932 Summer Olympics , the United States Olympic Committee reviewed the costs and revenue of the 1928 Games. The committee reported a total cost of US$ 1.183 million with receipts of US$1.165 million, giving a negligible loss of US$18,000, which was a considerable improvement over the 1924 Games. [ 2 ] The United States won the most gold and medals overall. Host city selection [ edit ] Dutch nobleman Frederik van Tuyll van Serooskerken first proposed Amsterdam as the host city for the Summer Olympic Games in 1912, even before the Netherlands Olympic Committee was established. The Olympic Games were canceled in 1916 due to World War I . In 1919, the Netherlands Olympic Committee abandoned the proposal of Amsterdam in favor of their support for the nomination of Antwerp as host city for the 1920 Summer Olympics . In 1921, Paris was selected for the 1924 Summer Olympics on the condition that the 1928 Summer Olympics would be organized in Amsterdam. This decision, supported by the Netherlands Olympic Committee, was announced by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on 2 June 1921. Los Angeles ' bid for the 1928 Summer Olympics was unsuccessful in 1922 and again in 1923. [ 3 ] The city was eventually selected as host city for the 1932 Summer Olympics , being the only bidder for that year.

        "   - For any classification task (e.g., botanical categories), you MUST verify each item explicitly against formal, authoritative sources.\n",
        "   - Use online searches, databases, or reference tools to confirm the classification.\n",

        "   - Use advanced operators if helpful: `site:` for domains, `inurl:` for internal paths, `filetype:` for formats.\n",
